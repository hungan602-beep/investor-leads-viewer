The Vikings routinely used to raid Britain and Ireland to capture slaves and sell them wherever they could get the best price. They also had a thriving business in capturing large numbers of Slavic people in Russia and the Ukraine and selling them down the river in the slave markets of the Middle East. (Slav -> Slave, note the derivation of the word).\n\nThe Vikings got a particularly good price for redheads and blondes in the Arab slave markets. There is a record of a red-haired Irish girl being sold to an Arab sheikh for an extremely high price. Vikings even sold each other as slaves whenever they got the chance. It was a highly competitive business.\n\nNorth African Muslims also conducted extensive slave raids all along the Mediterranean coasts and across Christian Europe even as far north as the British Isles. They captured millions of white slaves and sold them in Muslim countries. Barbary pirates captured slaves from Europe and, to an extent, North America, from the 16th to 19th centuries, until the US and British Navies brought it to a stop.\n\nRemember the line from the Marines' Hymn, “To the shores of Tripoli”? That refers to the First Barbary War when the US Marines acted to put a stop to the North African slave trade in white slaves. Of course, the Muslim pirates on the Barbary Coast were trading in black slaves as well, but they didn’t discriminate on the basis of color.\n\nIn all, Arab slave traders captured about 200 million slaves of all races, colors, and religions. Under Islamic laws, slavery was explicitly permitted, and Saudi Arabia, for instance, only abolished slavery in 1962 under pressure from Britain. ISIS is still capturing and selling slaves to this day.\n\nDarán Breathneach replied\nOf course their have been white slaves. Slavery is not immune to one person because of their race and has impacted the vast majority of races in this world.\n\nFollowing the collapse of Roman rule in Britain, Irish raiders raided Britain and brought home slaves to sell. The most famous victim of these raids has to be St. Patrick who was actually born in Wales.\n\nIn the following centuries, Ireland would go through its golden age due to it’s conversion of Christianity from paganism. Irish monks would preserve transcripts and wealth from Europe and keep them preserve in monasteries in Ireland. This would make Irish monasteries a very wealthy place and since monks would refused to have many weapons a easy place to raid with the first recorded viking raid in Ireland on 795. Word soon spread around Scandinavia and more raids were committed on monasteries in Great Britain and Ireland. By the late 9th and early 10th century, the Viking started settling the area around Dublin and by the 11th century, Dublin would became the biggest slave market in Western Europe.\n\nDue to the Viking settlement in Ireland, the vikings were able to take people in Ireland and either sell them or take them to Iceland in which they formed 40% of the founding population.\n\n“When the Vikings established early Scandinavian Dublin in 841, they began a slave market that would come to sell thralls captured both in Ireland and other countries as distant as Spain, as well as sending Irish slaves as far away as Iceland, where Gaels formed 40% of the founding population, and Anatolia. In 875, Irish slaves in Iceland launched Europe's largest slave rebellion since the end of the Roman Empire, when Hjörleifr Hróðmarsson's slaves killed him and fled to Vestmannaeyjar. Almost all recorded slave raids in this period took place in Leinster and southeast Ulster; while there was almost certainly similar activity in the south and west, only one raid from the Hebrides on the Aran Islands is recorded”[1]\n\nAccording to genetic evidence, around 62% of he Icelandic maternal gene pool is derived from Ireland and Scotland. The Irish and the Scottish Gaels were either slaves or servants of the Norse chiefs, according to the Icelandic sagas\n\n“Following Ingólfur, and also in 874, another group of Norwegians set sail across the North Atlantic Ocean with their families, livestock, slaves, and possessions, escaping the domination of the first King of Norway, Harald Fairhair. They traveled 1,000 km (600 mi) in their Viking longships to the island of Iceland. These people were primarily of Norwegian, Irish or Gaelic Scottish origin. The Irish and the Scottish Gaels were either slaves or servants of the Norse chiefs, according to the Icelandic sagas, or descendants of a \"group of Norsemen who had settled in Scotland and Ireland and intermarried with Gaelic-speaking people\". Genetic evidence suggests that approximately 62% of the Icelandic maternal gene pool is derived from Ireland and Scotland, which is much higher than other Scandinavian countries, although comparable to the Faroese, while 37% is of Nordic origin. About 20-25% of the Icelandic paternal gene pool is of Gaelic origin, with the rest being Nordic”[2]\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Slavery in Ireland - Wikipedia\n[2] Icelanders – Wikipedia", "sourceTweet": "True", "profileUrl": "https://x.com/LittleCoco83812"}, {"username": "haphapmystique", "displayName": "Dr Liz Hynes", "followers": 17, "following": 44, "bio": "Fascinated by the concept of universality and social constructs.", "verified": false, "replyLikes": 1, "replyText": "@elonmusk Never knew that factoid!
